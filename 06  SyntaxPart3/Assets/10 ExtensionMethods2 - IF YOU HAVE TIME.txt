        // Now, if you have time, do the Full Monte
        // Then use the .Split() method on string to split it into an array of words
        // iterate round the words in the array, taking the length of each word
        // to convert 1,2,3 to one hundred and twenty three
        // ((1 * 10) + 2) * 10 + 3
        // You will need to do this in a loop
        // and finally reduce it from 3141592 to 3.141592 by multiplying by 10 to the minus x
        //  double powerOf10 = Math.Pow(10, -(words.Length - 1));
        //  number = number* powerOf10;
        //  double result = Math.Round(number, 6);
